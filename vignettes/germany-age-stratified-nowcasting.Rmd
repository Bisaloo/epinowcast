In this vignette we explore using `epinowcast` to estimate COVID-19 hospitalisations by date of positive test in Germany stratified by age using several model specifications with different degrees of flexibility. We then evaluate the resulting nowcasts using visual checks, approximate leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation using Pareto smoothed importance sampling, and out of sample scoring using the weighted interval score and other scoring measures for the single report date considered here. Before working through this vignette reading the model definition is advised (`vignette("model-definition")`)

# Packages

We use the `epinowcast` package, `data.table` and `purrr` for data manipulation, `ggplot2` for plotting, `knitr` to produce tables of output, `loo` to approximately evaluate out of sample performance and `scoringutils` to evaluate out of sample forecast performance.
