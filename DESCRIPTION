Description: Tools to enable flexible and efficient hierarchical nowcasting of
    right censored epidemiological counts using a semi-mechanistic Bayesian
    method with support for both day of reference and day of report effects. 
    Nowcasting in this context is the estimation of the total notifications
    (for example hospitalisations or deaths) that will be reported for a given
    date based on those currently reported and the pattern of reporting for
    previous days. This can be useful when tracking the spread of infectious
    disease in real-time as otherwise changes in trends can be obfuscated by
    partial reporting or their detection may be delayed due to the use of simpler methods like truncation.
